# Portal Overview

## [Guides](portal-overview.md#guides)

Under guides, users can find step-by-step walk-throughs of setting up the environment, scaffolding projects or integrating the Crypto3 library in the projects.

## [Modules](portal-overview.md#modules)

{% hint style="info" %}
Crypto3 is written in C++. Bindings for other languages will be supported in the future.
{% endhint %}

Module descriptions/manuals are compartmentalised by programming language

### [C++](portal-overview.md#c++)

Under the language, the user can find the modules which the library implements. Under each, the user can expect to find the following pages.

* **Manual**: Describes the major components/APIs in the library and examples of usage.
* **Concepts:** Describes in abstract terms the traits and policies in which types are used.
* **References:** Doxygen generated documentation.

Optional guides:

* **Implementation**: Describes the architecture of the underlying implementation.
* **Extension**: Describes how to extend the library.

This guide is not designed to use in isolation and should be used in conjunction with the Doxygen-generated documentation. The aim of this guide is to introduce the user to major concepts and examples of the usage of the library.

## [Examples](portal-overview.md#examples)

This section will present some working examples of code combining different modules of the crypto3 suite.

## [Misc](portal-overview.md#misc)

This section covers other miscellaneous guidelines/information regarding contributing to the suite, code of conduct, feedback and contact details for collaboration.
