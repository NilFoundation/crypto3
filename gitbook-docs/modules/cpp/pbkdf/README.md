# PbKdf



The Crypto3.Pbkdf library extends the =nil;Foundation's cryptography suite. It provides a set of password-based key derivation functions implemented in the way the C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behaviour, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.

Crypto3.Pbkdf consists of several parts to review:

* Manual
* Implementation
* Concepts
