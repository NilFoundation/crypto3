# PkModes

The Crypto3.PkModes library extends the =nil;Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of modes for public key cryptography schemes defined in pubkey library (e.g. threshold) implemented in a way C++ standard library implies concepts, algorithms, predictable behaviour, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.

Crypto3.Modes consist of several parts to review:

* Manual
* Implementation
* Concepts
