# Stream



The Crypto3.Stream library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of stream ciphers implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.

Crypto3.Stream consists of several parts to review:

* Manual
* Implementation
* Concepts

A small part of each topic is reviewed right at introduction, but the detailed information is recommended to look inside of a corresponding chapter.
