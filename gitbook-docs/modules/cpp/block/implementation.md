# Implementation # {#block_ciphers_impl}

@tableofcontents

Block ciphers usage is usually split to three stages:

1. Initialization (key scheduling)
2. Accumulation (data processing/preprocessing)
3. Encryption

This separation defines the implementation architecture.

Some particular cases merge accumulation step with encryption step. This means 
block gets encrypted as far as it is found filled with enough data.  

## Architecture Overview ## {#block_ciphers_architecture}

Block cipher library architecture consists of several parts listed below:

1. Algorithms
2. Stream Processors
3. Cipher Algorithms
4. Accumulators
5. Value Processors

## Algorithms ## {#block_cipher_algorithms}

Implementation of a library is considered to be highly compliant with STL. So 
the crucial point is to have ciphers to be usable in the same way as STL 
algorithms do.

STL algorithms library mostly consists of generic iterator and since C++20 
range-based algorithms over generic concept-compliant types. Great example is 
`std::transform` algorithm:
 
```cpp
template<typename InputIterator, typename OutputIterator, typename UnaryOperation>
OutputIterator transform(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, OutputIterator out, UnaryOperation unary_op);
```

Input values of type `InputIterator` operate over any iterable range, no 
matter which particular type is supposed to be processed. While 
`OutputIterator` provides a type-independent output place for the algorithm 
to put results no matter which particular range this `OutputIterator` 
represents.
 
Since C++20 this algorithm got it analogous inside Ranges library as follows:
 
```cpp
template<typename InputRange, typename OutputRange, typename UnaryOperation>
OutputRange transform(InputRange rng, OutputRange out, UnaryOperation unary_op);
```

This particular modification takes no difference if `InputRange` is a 
`Container` or something else. The algorithm is generic just as data 
representation types are.
 
As much as such algorithms are implemented as generic ones, block cipher 
algorithms should follow that too:
 
```cpp
template<typename BlockCipher, typename InputIterator, typename KeyIterator, typename OutputIterator>
OutputIterator encrypt(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, KeyIterator kfirst, KeyIterator klast, OutputIterator out);
```

[`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) represents the particular block 
cipher will be used. `InputIterator` represents the input data coming to be 
encrypted. Since block ciphers rely on secret key `KeyIterator` represents the 
key data, and `OutputIterator` is exactly the same as it was in `std::transform` 
algorithm - it handles all the output storage operations.
 
The most obvious difference between `std::transform` is a representation of a 
policy defining the particular behaviour of an algorithm. `std::transform` 
proposes to pass it as a reference to `Functor`, which is also possible in 
case of [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) policy used in function 
already pre-scheduled:
   
```cpp
template<typename BlockCipher, typename InputIterator, typename KeyIterator, typename OutputIterator>
OutputIterator encrypt(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, KeyIterator kfirst, KeyIterator klast, OutputIterator out);
```

Algorithms are no more than an internal structures initializer wrapper. In this 
particular case algorithm would initialize stream processor fed with accumulator 
set with [`block`](@ref accumulators::block) accumulator inside initialized 
with [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) initialized with `KeyType` 
retrieved from input `KeyIterator` instances.

## Stream Data Processing ## {#block_cipher_stream}

Block ciphers are usually defined for processing `Integral` value typed byte 
sequences of specific size packed in blocks (e.g. `rijndael` is defined for 
blocks of words which are actually plain `n`-sized arrays of `uint32_t` ). 
Input data in the implementation proposed is supposed to be a various-length 
input stream, which length could be not even to block size.
  
This requires an introduction of stream processor specified with particular 
parameter set unique for each [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) type, 
which takes input data stream and gets it split to blocks filled with converted 
to appropriate size integers (words in the cryptography meaning, not machine words).
  
Example. Lets assume input data stream consists of 16 bytes as follows.

@dot
digraph bytes {
bgcolor="#151515"
node [shape=record color="#f5f2f1" fontcolor="#f5f2f1" fontname="helvetica"];

struct1 [label="0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03 | 0x04 | 0x05 | 0x06 | 0x07 | 0x08 | 0x09 | 0x10 | 0x11 | 0x12 | 0x13
 | 0x14 | 0x15"];
  
}
@enddot

Lets assume the selected cipher to be used is Rijndael with 32 bit word size, 
128 bit block size and 128 bit key size. This means input data stream needs to 
be converted to 32 bit words and merged to 128 bit blocks as follows:
  
@dot
digraph bytes_to_words {
bgcolor="#151515"
node [shape=record color="#f5f2f1" fontcolor="#f5f2f1" fontname="helvetica"];

struct1 [label="<b0> 0x00 |<b1> 0x01 |<b2> 0x02 |<b3> 0x03 |<b4> 0x04 |<b5> 0x05 |<b6> 0x06 |<b7> 0x07 |<b8> 0x08 |<b9> 0x09 |<b10> 0x10 |<b11> 0x11 |<b12> 0x12 |<b13> 0x13 |<b14> 0x14 |<b15> 0x15"];

struct2 [label="<w0> 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 |<w1> 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 |<w2> 0x08 0x09 0x10 0x11 |<w3> 0x12 0x13 0x14 0x15"];

struct3 [label="<bl0> 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x10 0x11 0x12 0x13 0x14
 0x15"];

struct1:b0 -> struct2:w0
struct1:b1 -> struct2:w0
struct1:b2 -> struct2:w0
struct1:b3 -> struct2:w0

struct1:b4 -> struct2:w1
struct1:b5 -> struct2:w1
struct1:b6 -> struct2:w1
struct1:b7 -> struct2:w1

struct1:b8 -> struct2:w2
struct1:b9 -> struct2:w2
struct1:b10 -> struct2:w2
struct1:b11 -> struct2:w2

struct1:b12 -> struct2:w3
struct1:b13 -> struct2:w3
struct1:b14 -> struct2:w3
struct1:b15 -> struct2:w3

struct2:w0 -> struct3:bl0
struct2:w1 -> struct3:bl0
struct2:w2 -> struct3:bl0
struct2:w3 -> struct3:bl0
}

@enddot

Now with this a [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) instance of 
[`rijndael`](@ref block::rijndael) can be fed.

This mechanism is handled with `stream_processor` template class specified for 
each particular cipher with parameters required. Block ciphers suppose only 
one type of stream processor exist - the one which split the data to blocks, 
converts them and passes to `AccumulatorSet` reference as cipher input of 
format required. The rest of data not even to block size gets converted too and 
fed value by value to the same `AccumulatorSet` reference.

## Data Type Conversion ## {#block_cipher_data}
 
Since block cipher algorithms are usually defined for `Integral` types or byte 
sequences of unique format for each cipher, encryption function being generic 
requirement should be handled with particular cipher-specific input data format 
converter.
  
For example [`rijndael` cipher](@ref block::rijndael) is defined over blocks of 
32 bit words, which could be represented with `uint32_t`. This means all the 
input data should be in some way converted to 4 byte sized `Integral` type. 
In case of `InputIterator` is defined over some range of `Integral` value
type, this is is handled with plain byte repack as shown in previous section. 
This is a case with both input stream and required data format are satisfy the 
same concept.
    
The more case with input data being presented by sequence of various type `T` 
requires for the `T` to has conversion operator `operator Integral()` to the 
type required by particular [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) policy.   
 
Example. Let us assume the following class is presented:
```cpp
class A {
public:
    std::size_t vals;
    std::uint16_t val16;
    std::char valc;
};
```

Now let us assume there exists an initialized and filled with random values 
`SequenceContainer` of value type `A`:

```cpp
std::vector<A> a;
```

To feed the [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) with the data presented, 
it is required to convert `A` to `Integral` type which is only available if `A` 
has conversion operator in some way as follows:
 
```cpp
class A {
public:
    operator uint128_t() {
        return (vals << (3U * CHAR_BIT)) & (val16 << 16) & valc;
    }

    std::size_t vals;
    std::uint16_t val16;
    std::char valc;
};
``` 

This part is handled internally with `stream_processor` configured for each 
particular cipher. 
   
## Block Cipher Algorithms ## {#block_cipher_policies}

Block cipher algorithms architecturally are stateful policies, which structural 
contents are regulated by concepts and runtime content is a scheduled key data. 
Block cipher policies are required to be compliant with 
[`BlockCipher` concept](@ref block_cipher_concept).

[`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) policies are required to be 
constructed with particular policy-compliant strictly-typed key data, usually 
represented by `BlockCipher::key_type`. This means construction of such a policy 
is quite a heavy task, so this should be handled with care. The result of 
a [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) construction is filled and 
strictly-typed key schedule data member. 

Once initialized with particular key, [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) 
policy is not meant to be reinitialized, but only destructed. Destruction of a 
[`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) instance should zeroize key schedule data.

Usually such a [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) policy would contain 
`constexpr static const std::size_t`-typed numerical cipher parameters, such as 
block bits, word bits, block words or cipher rounds.

Coming to typedefs contained in policy - they meant to be mostly a fixed-length 
arrays (usually `std::array`), which guarantees type-safety and no occasional 
input data length issues.

Functions contained in policy are meant to process one block of strictly-typed 
data (usually it is represented by `block_type` typedef) per call. 
Such functions are stateful with respect to key schedule data represented by 
`key_schedule_type` and generated while block cipher constructor call.

## Accumulators ## {#block_cipher_accumulators}

Encryption contains an accumulation step, which is implemented with 
[Boost.Accumulators](https://boost.org/libs/accumulators) library.

All the concepts are held.

Block ciphers contains pre-defined [`block::accumulator_set`](@ref nil::crypto3::block::accumulator_set), 
which is a `boost::accumulator_set` with pre-filled 
[`block` accumulator](@ref nil::crypto3::accumulators::block).

Block accumulator accepts only one either `block_type::value_type` or `block_type` 
at insert.

Accumulator is implemented as a caching one. This means there is an input cache 
sized as same as particular `BlockCipher::block_type`, which accumulates 
unprocessed data. After it gets filled, data gets encrypted, then it gets moved 
to the main accumulator storage, then cache gets emptied. 
 
[`block` accumulator](@ref accumulators::block) internally uses
[`bit_count` accumulator](@ref accumulators::bit_count) and designed to be 
combined with other accumulators available for
[Boost.Accumulators](https://boost.org/libs/accumulators).
 
Example. Let's assume there is an accumulator set, which intention is to encrypt 
all the incoming data with [`rijndael<128, 128>` cipher](@ref block::rijndael)
and to compute a [`sha2<256>` hashes](@ref hashes::sha2) of all the incoming data
as well.

This means there will be an accumulator set defined as follows:
```cpp
using namespace boost::accumulators;
using namespace nil::crypto3;

boost::accumulator_set<
    accumulators::block<block::rijndael<128, 128>>,
    accumulators::hash<hashes::sha2<256>>> acc;
```

Extraction is supposed to be defined as follows:
```cpp
std::string hash = extract::hash<hashes::sha2<256>>(acc);
std::string ciphertext = extract::block<block::rijndael<128, 128>>(acc);
```

## Value Postprocessors ## {#block_cipher_value}

Since the accumulator output type is strictly tied to [`digest_type`](@ref block::digest_type)
of particular [`BlockCipher`](@ref block_cipher_concept) policy, the output 
format in generic is closely tied to digest type too. Digest type is usually
defined as fixed or variable length byte array, which is not always the format of 
container or range user likes to store output in. It could easily be a 
`std::vector<uint32_t>` or a `std::string`, so there is a [`cipher_value`](@ref cipher_value)
state holder which is made to be implicitly convertible to various container and 
range types with internal data repacking implemented.

Such a state holder is split to a couple of types:
1. Value holder. Intended to have an internal output data storage. 
Actually stores the `AccumulatorSet` with digest data.
2. Reference holder. Intended to store a reference to external `AccumulatorSet`, 
which is usable in case of data gets appended to existing accumulator.
