# <span style='font-family: monospace'>=nil;</span> Crypto3 C++ Cryptography Suite {#mainpage}

@tableofcontents

Crypto3 cryptography suite's purpose is:
1. To provide a secure, fast and architecturally clean C++ generic cryptography schemes implementation.
2. To provide a developer-friendly, modular suite, usable for novel schemes implementation and further
 extension.
3. To provide a Standard Template Library-alike C++ interface and concept-based architecture implementation.

Libraries are designed to be state of the art, highly performant and providing a one-stop solution for
all cryptographic operations. They are supported on all operating systems (*nix, windows, macOS)
and architectures(x86/ARM).


See [contribution](contributing.md) guidelines if you wish to contribute to the project.

## Modules
Cryptography suite contains multiple modules from trivial encoding (e.g. base64), encryption, hashing
to complex protocols (e.g. threshold schemes, zero-knowledge protocol or verifiable delay functions).

Detailed list of modules with tutorials is available at [Modules page](modules.html).

## Usage

Cryptography suite can be used as follows:

1. Generic.
2. Selective.

The suite is used as a header-only and is currently statically linked. Future versions will allow dynamic linking.

#### Generic
Generic usage of cryptography suite consists of all modules available at
[GitHub =nil; Crypto3 Team Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/NilFoundation/teams/nil-crypto3/repositories).
An umbrella-repository of it is available at  [Crypto3 GitHub](https://github.com/nilfoundation/crypto3.git). Modules
are added as submodules emplaced in `libs` directory. A developer can thus add this
project as a submodule and would not need to resolve dependencies. See [crypto3-scaffold](https://github.com/NilFoundation/crypto3-scaffold) as an example of usage.

### Selective
Developer can select to include a one or more modules to reduce the sources of resulting project and dependencies tree height. This however
does require the developer to manually resolve all required dependencies and stay upto date regarding
compatibilities across modules.
